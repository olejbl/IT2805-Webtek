1. Why does the following expression 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 evaluate to false in Javascript?
Because of binary representations of floating point values. 0.1 in binary isnt the same as 0.1 in the base 10 system. Therefore 0.1 + 0.3 isnÂ´t STRICTLY the same. 

2. What does the method attribute on a form element decide?
It specifies how to send form-data. GET or POST. 
GET appends the data into the URL
POST appends the data inside the body of the HTTP request

3. Explain why the form fields appear in the URL when the method on form element is
changed to GET ?

As explained above. It is not used for sensitive data. And it is good when the user wants to store the result. 


4. Why is it considered bad practice to only validate form input with HTML5 and/or
Javascript?

You should still do validation on the server, because you can turn off JavaScript and submit junk. 



5. When is it appropriate to use textarea over input ?

When you expect a user to enter multi-line text, e.g. in an application form.
